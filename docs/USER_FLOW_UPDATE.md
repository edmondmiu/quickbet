# QuickBet User Flow Update - Summary of Changes

## Previous Flow (Tinder-style)
- User swipes RIGHT on match = show questions in separate panel
- User swipes LEFT on match = skip/reject match
- Questions shown in separate view after swiping

## New Flow (All-in-one cards)
- Each match card shows match info AND betting questions together
- User selects options and taps "Add to Bet Slip" button
