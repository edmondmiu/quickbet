# QuickBet UI Improvements - Summary

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Card Visibility**
**Problem**: Cards behind the active card were not visible.

**Solution**: 
- Changed card layout from horizontal translation to stacked positioning
- Increased top offset from 15px to 20px per card
- Increased left/right offset from 5px to 8px per card
- Reduced container height from 600px to 520px
- Increased opacity of background cards from 0.3 to 0.6
- Shows up to 3 cards in the stack (current + 2 behind)

### 2. **Question Format**
**Problem**: Questions weren't posed as actual questions and answers weren't consistent Yes/No.

**Solution**:
- Added question marks to all questions
- Changed all answers to simple "Yes" and "No"
- Increased question font size from text-lg to text-xl and made it bold
- Changed answer text from text-lg to text-2xl bold
- Examples:
  - "Will Manchester United hold on to win this match?"
  - "Will El Cl√°sico see the first goal before 30 minutes?"

### 3. **Swipe Direction**
**Problem**: Swipe directions were counterintuitive (right = next, left = previous).

**Solution**:
- Reversed swipe logic to match natural mobile patterns
- Swipe LEFT = Next card
- Swipe RIGHT = Previous card
- Updated navigation buttons to match
- Added clearer swipe hint: "‚Üê Swipe for next ‚Ä¢ Swipe for previous ‚Üí"

### 4. **Card Size Optimization**
- Reduced card padding from p-6 to p-5
- Reduced team name size from text-2xl to text-xl
- Reduced score size from text-3xl to text-2xl
- Reduced spacing between elements
- Made the cards more compact overall

## üìê Visual Result

- Cards now stack visually with clear depth perception
- You can see 2-3 cards behind the active one
- Questions are prominent and easy to read
- Yes/No format reduces cognitive load
- Natural swipe gestures (left = forward, right = back)
