# QuickBet - Bug Fixes Applied

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Selection Bug - All Cards Showing Selected**
**Problem**: When selecting an option on one match card, all other match cards would also show as selected.

**Cause**: All matches were receiving the same questions with the same IDs, so selecting question "q_001" would affect all cards that had that question.

**Fix**: Updated `dataLoader.ts` to map specific questions to specific matches:
```typescript
const questionMapping: Record<string, string[]> = {
  'match_001': ['q_001'],
  'match_002': ['q_002'],
  'match_003': ['q_003'],
  // ... etc
};
```

Now each match has its own unique question, preventing cross-card selection issues.

### 2. **Navigation Buttons**
**Problem**: The "Previous" and "Next" text at the bottom were just static hints, not clickable buttons.

**Fix**: Converted them to proper buttons with:
- Click handlers that call `handleSwipe()`
- Hover states (white text + gray background)
- Disabled states when at first/last match
- Proper styling with rounded corners and padding

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. **src/utils/dataLoader.ts**
   - Added question-to-match mapping
   - Each match now gets exactly one unique question

2. **src/App.tsx**
   - Replaced static navigation hints with clickable buttons
   - Added proper disabled states and styling
   - Counter now has a pill-shaped background

## üéÆ Result

- Selecting a bet on one card no longer affects other cards
- Users can click Previous/Next buttons in addition to swiping
- Navigation is more intuitive with proper button states
- Each match shows its own unique compelling question

## ‚úÖ Testing

1. Select "Yes they will!" on the Manchester United card
2. Swipe or click Next to go to Barcelona vs Real Madrid
3. Notice the selection is NOT carried over
