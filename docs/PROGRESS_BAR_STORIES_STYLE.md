# QuickBet - Progress Bar Update

## ðŸ“Š Progress Indicator Redesign

### **Previous Issue**
The progress bars were hidden behind the match cards at the bottom of the card stack, making them invisible and useless.

### **New Design - Instagram Stories Style**
Moved progress bars to the top of the screen, just like Instagram Stories, TikTok, and other social media apps.

### **Features**
- **Fixed Position**: Always visible at the very top of the screen
- **Full Width**: Spans across the entire screen width
- **Visual States**:
  - ðŸ”² **Empty bars** (white/20) = Upcoming matches
  - â¬œ **Filled bars** (white) = Viewed matches  
  - â¬œâœ¨ **Pulsing bar** = Current match
- **Smooth Transitions**: Bars fill smoothly as you swipe
- **Gradient Background**: Dark gradient for better visibility

### **Technical Details**
```css
- Position: fixed top-0 z-50
- Height: 0.5rem (thinner than before)
- Gap: 1.5 (6px) between bars
- Background: gradient from black/50 to transparent
- Animation: pulse on current match
```

### **User Experience**
1. Users can always see their progress through matches
2. Clear indication of how many matches remain
3. Familiar pattern from social media stories
4. No interference with card visibility
5. Works perfectly with swipe navigation

### **Visual Result**
The progress bars now look and feel exactly like Instagram Stories or TikTok's progress indicator, making the app feel more modern and familiar to users who are used to swiping through content on social media platforms.
